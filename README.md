# Holidays For You

Holidays For You is a holiday platform designed to help users find spot of interest near them or near to where they're going. This can all be achieved easily through the use of the 
Google Maps and Places API. The API is situated within the centre of the page beneath a row of promotion cards. The API itself is easy and intuitive to use, however not all users are alike 
so a few lines of instructions are written in a non formal manner to help users make the most of the websites capabilities.  
Alongside this the site will allow for booking of holidays and then suggest using the map to help them plan their trip. As of right now that is in development. However, the website holidays has 
been made in mind to accomodate these changes, by having buttons in place to link to these places, as well as a common theme in mind to use across the pages. Bootstrap has also been used 
to help in the presentation of elements on the page.
