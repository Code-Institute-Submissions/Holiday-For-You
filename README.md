# Holidays For You

Holidays For You is a holiday platform designed to help users find spot of interest near them or near to where they're going. This can all be achieved easily through the use of the 
Google Maps and Places API. The API is situated within the centre of the page beneath a row of promotion cards. The API itself is easy and intuitive to use, however not all users are alike 
so a few lines of instructions are written in a non formal manner to help users make the most of the websites capabilities.  
Alongside this the site will allow for booking of holidays and then suggest using the map to help them plan their trip. As of right now that is in development. However, the website holidays has 
been made in mind to accomodate these changes, by having buttons in place to link to these places, as well as a common theme in mind to use across the pages. Bootstrap has also been used 
to help in the presentation of elements on the page. 

## UX

Holidays For You was designed to be an extension of a holiday booking site. To achieve this the Google Maps and Places API has been integrated into the website, with the purpose of allowing 
visitors to see local attractions before or after they arrive at their destination. The webpage is left relatively empty to focus on the API, this helps users not get distracted on their way 
down to the map positioned near the bottom of page. The reason for this is so users must pass by promotions on bigger screens, and more importantly the instructions on how to use the API before 
arriving at it. This is to help users understand how to use the software before they even get to it. This is so users with less experience with these types of applications don't get frustrated, 
leaving the site prematurely. 

The reason for my site being an appropriate way to achieve the intended goal is the software is simple and intuitive to use lacking any unnecessary features involved with the working of the API. 
The process of getting to the map is stream lined and easy, no matter what screen size the user is on the instructions for the map are always visible allowing the user to always know they are in 
the right place and have not become lost. 

In terms of the theme of the page I have used a skyblue in colaboration with the plane logo to represent the travel that the users will be taken. On top of this black has been chosen as the 
colour of the type face to make it stand out, allowing users to easily read the text. along with this the Montserrat Alternates font has been used as this provides an easy to read and 
aesthetically pleasing appeal. Another aspect of the header is the nav bar which is left simple making use of drop downs allowing for main categories and sub-categories of linked pages, as 
well as on smaller screens the entirety of the nav bar becomes a drop. This is to avoid it taking up too much screen real estate. The final aspect is that the header has a shadow effect this is 
to create the illusion of depth, as well as the coordinate with the place logo giving the effect of flight.

Straight after the header is a row of promational cards. These are formatted showing an image of the destination followed by a brief description of the area. This is so the user can at glance get 
information on these promations without paying much attention to them. On a larger screen this format works very well. However, on a screen with less space these would take up too much space. 
To combat this the cards shrink in stages first they go from four to three so the cards are still readable, second the text disappears leaving just the image, this stops the user being able 
to get information at a glance despite this the eye catching images should still entice the user to click on a card and learn more from there. Third the cards disappear all together leaving 
just the instructions and the API. 

Following after is the instructions for the API and the API itself. In terms of the instructions they put into steps to achieve this four separate &lt;p&gt; tags have been used. Forming them in 
their own rows created the illusion of a "1. 2. 3. 4." step count without forcing the user to do so. This area is left plain for the sake of not taking away from the user's attention on the 
information they are receiving. 

For the API map the styling have been left how the creator intended them this is because is the formatting is the same as that as Google Maps. So users that are familiar with that platform will 
feel at home here. This allows for intuitive use of the API.
